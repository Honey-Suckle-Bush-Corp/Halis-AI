   - utter_iamabot  
   - utter_cheer_up  
   - utter_did_that_help  
   - utter_happy

**SESSION UPDATES (Since 2025-05-24):**  

9. Added new intent: `ask_journal_prompt`  
10. Created a custom action `action_journal_prompt` that returns a randomized reflective journal question.  
11. Connected `ask_journal_prompt` to its custom action in `domain.yml` and `stories.yml`.  
12. Added `nlu_fallback` and `utter_default` to handle misunderstood inputs.  
13. Created structured `stories.yml` to include happy, sad, and support interaction paths.  
14. Built and tested `nlu.yml` with new and refined example phrases for all intents.  
15. Set up `actions.py` with logic to deliver custom journal prompts.  
16. Created a batch file with a menu system to:  
    - Activate environment  
    - Train model  
    - Run Rasa shell  
    - View logs  
17. Added activity logging that appends each command usage to `activity_log.txt`.  
18. Began planning next features:  
    - Capturing user journal responses  
    - Adding forms and slots  
    - Backing up project state  

Everything remains functional. Batch system works. Current model handles basic greetings, mood tracking, and journaling reflection. Halis is ready for the next phase: **capturing user input and expanding mental health support tools**.
