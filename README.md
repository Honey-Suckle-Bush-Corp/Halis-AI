# Halis 🤖🧘‍♀️

**Halis** is an open-source conversational AI designed to support **mental health resilience**. Built using [Rasa](https://rasa.com/), Halis offers non-clinical companionship for individuals navigating challenging moments, providing encouragement, clarity, and a gentle reminder that they're not alone.

## 🌟 Purpose

Halis is **not a therapist** — it’s a steady digital companion that listens, reflects, and empowers users to better understand their emotions and stay grounded. It can:

- Offer daily emotional check-ins
- Provide affirmations and grounding exercises
- Suggest coping strategies
- Help articulate feelings for therapy support
- Gently recommend professional resources if needed
